## ✅ Implementation Status: PRODUCTION READY

**Module:** Products / SKU
**Date Completed:** December 1, 2025
**Testing Status:** Backend ✅ | Frontend ✅

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### Backend Updates (`/app/backend/server.py`)

**1. Enhanced DELETE Endpoint**
```python
@api_router.delete("/products/{product_id}")
```
- ✅ Added referential integrity checks for:
  - Proforma Invoices (PI)
  - Purchase Orders (PO)
  - Inward Stock
  - Outward Stock
- ✅ Returns 400 error with detailed message if product is referenced
- ✅ Soft delete (sets `is_active: False`)
- ✅ Audit logging with user_id and timestamp

**2. New Bulk Delete Endpoint**
```python
@api_router.post("/products/bulk-delete")
```
- ✅ Accepts: `{"ids": ["id1", "id2", ...]}`
- ✅ Processes each product individually
- ✅ Returns detailed results:
  - `deleted_count`: Number successfully deleted
  - `deleted_ids`: Array of deleted IDs
  - `failed_count`: Number that failed
  - `failed`: Array with {id, reason} for each failure
- ✅ Referential integrity checks for each product
- ✅ Audit logging for each successful deletion

**3. New Export Endpoint**
```python
@api_router.get("/products/export")
```
- ✅ Supports `format` query parameter (json, csv)
- ✅ Returns all active products
- ✅ Removes internal `_id` field
- ✅ Structured for frontend CSV/Excel processing

**Critical Fix Applied:**
- Fixed FastAPI route ordering issue
- Moved export route before parameterized routes to prevent path conflict

---

### Frontend Updates (`/app/frontend/src/pages/Products.jsx`)

**Complete Rewrite with Bulk Operations:**

**1. New Components Integrated:**
- ✅ `BulkActionToolbar` - Shows when items selected
- ✅ `DeleteConfirmDialog` - Reusable confirmation modal
- ✅ Export utilities (`exportToCSV`, `exportToExcel`)

**2. New State Management:**
```javascript
- selectedIds: [] // Tracks selected products
- deleteDialogOpen: boolean
- productToDelete: object
```

**3. New Features:**
- ✅ Master checkbox (select/deselect all)
- ✅ Individual row checkboxes
- ✅ Bulk action toolbar with:
  - Selected count display
  - Clear selection button
  - Export CSV button
  - Export Excel button
  - Delete Selected button
- ✅ Search integration (filters affect selection and export)
- ✅ Enhanced delete confirmation with product name
- ✅ Edit functionality (already existed, preserved)

**4. Handler Functions:**
```javascript
- handleSelectAll() // Master checkbox
- handleSelectRow() // Individual checkbox
- handleExportCSV() // Filter-aware CSV export
- handleExportExcel() // Filter-aware Excel export
- handleBulkDelete() // Bulk deletion with confirmation
- handleDeleteConfirm() // Single delete with referential checks
```

## 📊 Referential Integrity Rules

**Products Cannot Be Deleted If Referenced In:**

1. **Proforma Invoices (PI)**
   - Check: `performa_invoices.line_items.product_id`
   - Error: "Referenced in X PI(s)"

2. **Purchase Orders (PO)**
   - Check: `purchase_orders.line_items.product_id`
   - Error: "Referenced in X PO(s)"

3. **Inward Stock**
   - Check: `inward_stock.line_items.product_id`
   - Error: "Referenced in X Inward(s)"

4. **Outward Stock**
   - Check: `outward_stock.line_items.product_id`
   - Error: "Referenced in X Outward(s)"

**Example Error Message:**
```
Cannot delete product. It is referenced in 2 PI(s), 3 PO(s), 5 Inward(s), and 1 Outward(s). Delete those records first.
```

---

## 🎯 Filter-Aware Export

**Behavior:**
- **No selection**: Exports all filtered products
- **With selection**: Exports only selected products from filtered results
- **Search active**: Export respects search filter

**Field Mapping for Export:**
```javascript
{
  'sku_name': 'SKU Name',
  'category': 'Category',
  'brand': 'Brand',
  'hsn_sac': 'HSN/SAC',
  'country_of_origin': 'Country of Origin',
  'color': 'Color',
  'specification': 'Specification',
  'feature': 'Feature',
  'is_active': 'Status'
}
```

## 💡 Special Notes

**Known Enhancements for Future:**
- Export success toasts could be more prominent (downloads work, but toast timing could improve)
- Consider adding batch size limits for very large bulk operations

**Performance:**
- Tested with 32 products - performs excellently
- Bulk operations process quickly
- No noticeable lag in UI

**Security:**
- All operations require authentication
- Audit logs capture user_id for accountability
- Referential integrity prevents data corruption
