# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Note: company_id filter shows limitation due to inward entries not inheriting company_id from PO. ✅ Phase 5 - Transaction History: GET /api/stock-transactions/{product_id}/{warehouse_id} working perfectly, returns ONLY warehouse inward + export invoice transactions with proper structure (type, date, reference_no, quantity, rate, amount), sorted by date (most recent first). ✅ Phase 6 - Delete Functionality: DELETE /api/stock-summary/{stock_id} working correctly, removes stock entry from summary, preserves original inward/outward entries, creates audit log. ✅ Phase 7 - Edge Cases: Verified fresh entry creation after delete, proper quantity calculations. MINOR ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Inward entries don't inherit company_id from linked PO, causing company_name='Unknown' and company_id=None in stock tracking. This doesn't affect core functionality but limits company filtering. All critical Stock Summary Rebuild requirements successfully validated and production-ready."

BUSINESS LOGIC CONFIRMED: FIFO consumption works correctly, pickup quantities decrease as expected, fully consumed pickups marked as 'fully_received', stock summary updates reflect changes, stats endpoint shows correct remaining allowed calculations, validation prevents exceeding PO quantities.

STOCK MOVEMENT FLOW VERIFICATION
Date: 2025-10-15
========================================

REQUIREMENT:
Complete stock movement flow must work as follows:
1. Pick-up Inward Stock → Inward to Warehouse (Inward + Done)
2. Inward to Warehouse (Done) → Appears in Dispatch Plan
3. Dispatch Plan → Export Invoice (Create/Remove)
4. Export Invoice (Created) → Stock dispatched from warehouse
5. Stock Summary → Shows correct categorization

Testing this flow end-to-end...

These are derived states calculated from outwardEntries (lines 72-74), causing infinite re-render loop. Every time useEffect ran and updated filtered states, these derived values were recalculated, triggering the useEffect again. SOLUTION: 1) Added useMemo import from React, 2) Wrapped dispatchEntries, exportEntries, and directEntries calculations in React.useMemo with [outwardEntries] dependency, 3) Removed outwardEntries from useEffect dependency array (now only depends on searchTerm, filters, and the memoized derived states). This prevents infinite loop by ensuring derived states are only recalculated when outwardEntries actually changes, not on every render."

    message: "🎯 PI TO PO MAPPING HIERARCHICAL FORMAT TESTING COMPLETED - NEW format implementation verified through comprehensive UI testing with detailed screenshots captured. ✅ CRITICAL TESTING RESULTS: Successfully logged in as rutuja@bora.tech, navigated to Customer Tracking page, and clicked View (eye icon) on first entry (PI: BMLP/25/PI/12). ✅ PI to PO Mapping Section: Found and accessed PI to PO Mapping section in View dialog, section loads correctly with proper API integration (/customer-management/pi-po-mapping). ✅ Blue Gradient Header: Confirmed blue gradient PI Number header is implemented (.bg-gradient-to-r.from-blue-600.to-blue-700) showing PI Number, Date, Consignee, and Linked PO count. ✅ NEW Hierarchical Format Code: Verified complete NEW format implementation in CustomerTracking.jsx with 7-column table structure (SKU | Product Name | PI Quantity | PI Product Rate | PO Quantity | PO Product Rate | Remaining Quantity), numbered PO list format (1) PO-XXX, 2) PO-YYY), ₹ symbol integration for rates, proper color coding for remaining quantities. ✅ Empty State Handling: Confirmed proper empty state message 'No Purchase Orders linked to this PI yet' when PIs have 0 linked POs. ⚠️ DATA LIMITATION: Current test data shows all PIs have 0 linked POs, preventing full verification of NEW format with actual rates and hierarchical structure. However, code analysis confirms complete implementation of requested format. ✅ Screenshots Captured: Multiple detailed screenshots taken showing dialog sections (top customer info, middle inward/dispatch tracking, bottom PI to PO mapping). CONCLUSION: NEW hierarchical format with rates is fully implemented and ready for production. Requires test data with linked POs to demonstrate complete functionality."
